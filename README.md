#  NeosVRMLImporter


A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that enables the import of VRML 1.0, VRML 2.0 and X3D 3D models.

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
1. Place [VRMLImporter.dll](https://github.com/dfgHiatus/NeosVRMLImporter/releases/tag/v1.0.0) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Install and extract [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/) to your Neos tools folder. This can be found under `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\tools\Blender` for a default install.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
